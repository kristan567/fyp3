# Construction Field Management System

## 2.1 Aim

The aim of this project is to develop a Construction Field Management System that assists businesses and organizations in designing their field operations. By enhancing resource management and productivity, the system enables companies to make data-driven decisions.

## 2.2 Goals

Field Management Systems (CMS) are tools that assist in coordinating and optimizing field activities such as project scheduling, cost management, and quality control. The CMS provides construction professionals and field workers with tools to:

- **Create Schedules and Assign Tasks:** Improve project management by organizing tasks and timelines effectively.
- **Reduce Project Failure Risks:** Increase visibility, efficiency, and collaboration to minimize the risk of project failure.
- **Enhance Supervision:** Enable real-time monitoring of progress, including the ability to send emails and upload images to show task progress.
- **Promote Collaboration:** Facilitate better communication and collaboration among field workers.
- **Manage Documents and Reports:** Allow project managers to handle documents, generate reports, and review them, reducing the risk of losing important files.
- **Provide Personalized Recommendations:** Offer recommendations for building houses and buildings based on plans and management data from previous projects.

The main goals of the project are to:

- Periodize goals and schedules.
- Implement real-time monitoring.
- Improve construction practices.
